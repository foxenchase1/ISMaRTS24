# ISMaRTS24
A collection of models and interactive MATLAB scripts for variational calculus problems related to the classical brachistochrone problem. These files (.m) may be compatible with GNU Octave, but this is not guaranteed. I am going to attempt to make it compatible so that these results are available to the FOSS community. 

These are not complete models and need some work to be polished up. Further, I have additional ideas for expanding these models into more complex scenarios (e.g., a brachistochrone under drag and variable gravity in spherical coordinates where the user specifies the endpoints). More importantly, I need to create comprehensive documentation explaining the code for others (and even myself at times!).
